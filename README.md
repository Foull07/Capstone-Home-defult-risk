# Home Credit Default Risk

## Project Overview
This project addresses the financial inclusion challenge by predicting loan applicants' repayment abilities using alternative data sources. The predictive models aim to reduce default rates while increasing approval rates for creditworthy individuals.

## Business Problem
Home Credit seeks to foster financial inclusion by providing secure loans to individuals who lack traditional credit histories. The primary challenge is accurately assessing creditworthiness to reduce default rates while ensuring loan approvals for deserving clients. This project aims to develop a predictive model for loan defaults using demographic, financial, and behavioral data, aligning with the company's goals of improving financial access and maintaining operational stability.

## Approach to solving the business problem (Group)
Our solution involves building machine learning models to predict loan defaults. We performed exploratory data analysis to identify key features and address anomalies, followed by feature engineering and model training. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were evaluated based on AUC and precision-recall metrics. Random Forest emerged as the most effective model for accurate prediction and generalization.

## Business value generated by the solution (Group)
The predictive model developed in this project provides Home Credit with a data-driven approach to assess loan applicants. By leveraging alternative data sources and advanced analytics, the model helps minimize default rates, optimize loan approvals, and enhance customer experience. This ensures financial stability while expanding credit access to underserved populations.

## Contribution to the project
My primary contributions to the project included explaining the predictive models in the notebook and delivering an in-class presentation on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. During the presentation, I showcased key insights, including patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data, and explained how these findings informed the feature engineering and modeling phases. Additionally, I provided clear explanations of the models in the notebook, covering their methodology, evaluation, and business implications, ensuring that the technical details were accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Challenges
- Addressing class imbalance between defaulters (8%) and non-defaulters (92%).
- Identifying the most relevant features from a large dataset with over 120 variables.

## Lessons Learned
This project enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing, particularly in addressing missing values and outliers. I gained practical experience in feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, I learned the importance of aligning machine learning solutions with business objectives to ensure actionable insights and measurable impactâ€‹
